## Project Idea & Motivation  
Many people go through emotional changes every day because of stress, work, or personal challenges. However, they often find it difficult to understand how they feel.  
This project aims to build an **Emotional Health Advisor** that can detect a person’s emotion from short text input, such as a message or a journal entry, using machine learning techniques.  

We chose this idea because emotional health is an important part of overall well-being, but many people don’t have access to quick or easy support.  
This system can help users become more aware of their emotions and understand them better.

## Dataset

- **Name:** Emotions Dataset for NLP  

- **Source:** Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp/data  

- **Type:** Text dataset (short English sentences) labeled with emotions: sadness, joy, love, anger, fear.

## Goal
- Build a classifier that detects the emotion of a short text.
- Explore the data and preprocess text for modeling.
